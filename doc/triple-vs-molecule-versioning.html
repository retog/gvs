<H1>Triple oriented vs. molecule oriented versioning</H1>
<P>Finding the right level of granularity for versioning. 
</P>
<H2>Triple oriented approach</H2>
<P>The idea is to add the versioning information to each triple. This
could be implemented by adding two extra columns to the table in
which the triples are stored, one containing the revision number from
which the triple is valid and one containing the number of the first
revision in which the triple is no longer contained (the value of
this column may be null).</P>
<P>An implemtational consequence of the triple based approach is that
anonymous nodes can keep an identity across versions, i.e. the
identifier in the field of the table of triples. A triple oriented
versioning system may or may not expose this identity, depending on
this the possible ways to keep the number of recorded changes low
are:</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Store the transactions made
	through a model API or with a query[?] language and assume the
	application won't make unnecessary revocations/re-assertions 
	</P>
	<LI><P>An algorithm to find a matching from anonymous resources in
	the old version to anonymous resources in the new version so that
	the number of revocations/re-assertions is minimal 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>The approach discussed here is the first one, this approach allows
the API user to pint to an anonymous resource across different
versions. 
</P>
<H2>Molecule based approach</H2>
<P>Molecules are elements of a lossless decomposition of a graph,
i.e. a graph can be decomposed into molecules without loosing
information and without assigning a cross-component identity to
bnodes. To such a molecule the information&nbsp;</P>

<BR>With the triple oriented approach the changes that happen in the
database reflect the transactions done on Model. Some java code
modifying the Model could have changed the properties of existing
anonymous resources in which case in the database 3 statements get
invalidated for the new version while 3 other statements start to be
valid. If however the program would have imported the new version
from a file and update the model without additional knowledge or
guessing, all properties of the two anonymous resources in the old
version would have been invalidated and a total of 8 statements
added.<BR><BR>With the molecule based approach the validity
information stored in the meta-model refers to the following
molecules:</P>

In terms of total number of triples stored the molecule approach is
as high as the worst case in the triple oriented approach, the number
of component assertions/revocation is however equals to best case in
the triple oriented approach, 3 things get revoked and 3 asserted.
The minimal changes to the database possible with the triple oriented
approach relies on the external knowledge of the programmer or user
(which would reflect in different changes depending of whether Reto
changed his name or one Reto left and another one joined). <BR>If the
two anonymous resource would have constant inverse functional
properties in the two versions the recorded changes about the
anonymous resources would be smaller:</P>

<H2>Different usage scenarios</H2>
<H3>Synchronization</H3>
<P>Both approaches allow the transfer of changes to a remote system.
For the triple oriented approach two keep the data transfered low the
anonymous node have constant identifier across the systems, this is
not a problem if one system is a read-only copy of the other but in
the situation that both model can be idenpendently changed the result
of synchronization of two true models could be a false one.</P>
<H3>Aggregation</H3>
<P>An aggregator records the changes from different sources, this is
possible with both approaches as long as with the triple based
approach the b-node IDs are globally unique, if different sources
assert the same information the aggregator has to store both b-node
ids.</P>
<H3>Resource oriented API</H3>
<P>The Java code</P>
<PRE>Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
Resource r1 = model.createResource(FOAF.Person);
Resource r2 = model.createResource(FOAF.Person);</PRE><P>
creates a non-lean expressing the same content as the one created by</P>
<PRE>Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
Resource r1 = model.createResource(FOAF.Person);</PRE><P>
a dynamic merging however, would probably break the expectations of
the user of the OO language. As long as the java objects life they
cannot be threated as existential variables but must be threated as
things with own identity. With the triple oriented approach this is
straight forward as the different object maps to bNode ids, the java
instances can be stored losslessly in the system. <BR>A molecule
based stored guarantees to keep the asserted content, redundant
information may and ideally should be removed so that the returned
graphs are lean. The space of Java instances can be seen as a scratch
board which converts to RDF when it is committed, the framework could
be designed so to discourage the programmer keeping references to
(anonymous) resources between transaction and/or switch the objects
in a &quot;read-only&quot; mode after committing.</P>
<H3>Storing named graphs</H3>
<P>A triple oriented store may well store multiple named graphs the
graph in which a triple is contained could be an additional field in
the database table. A triple may thus be stored several times and be
considered distinct depending on the containing graph, the same bNode
id never appears in two graphs.<BR>The GVS-Concept of <I>Source</I>
is a named graph changing over time, a molecule may be asserted by
several sources. Isomorphic molecules are never stored twice which
makes it easy and fast to return the union of several overlapping
models.</P>
<H3>Diffs</H3>
<P>From the molecule-based store it is trivial to extract diffs which
do not depend on b-node ids. The advantage of such a diff is that it
has a context independent meaning, i.e. knowing the meaning of the
named resources is sufficient to conceive the meaning. For instance a
diff depending on b-node ids can only reasonable be signed with
reference to the context of the resource in the compared models.</P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<P>The triple oriented versioning approach suits nicely into a
scenario where anonymous resource are threated similarly to named
resources, i.e where graphs are not leanified and a API user can keep
references to anonymous resources. The molecule oriented approach is
to be preferred when the relevant information is the expressed
content according to RDF-Semantics and where there is no way aside
the expressed meaning expressed by two versions of a graph to
associated anonymous resources as being a time variing resource.

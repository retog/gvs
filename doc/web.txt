The package com.hp.hpl.jena.gvs.web provides a restfull intervace to a gvs-store.

Retrieving versions:

A version of a graph from source with url SOURCE can be retrieved either dereferencing SOURCE with an 
optional GET-Parameter "moment" or by invoking a service-URL ("/gvs") passing SOURCE as value of the get parameter 
"source". The second method allows multiple "source"-parameter for getting the union of the graph-version
of multiple sources.


Adding versions: (TODO)

A new version of a graph can be set with a PUT request at the URL of the source.



Retreiving modification-dates: (TODO)

Nearby-dates of modification are returned with the http-response header X-GVS-Previous and  
X-GVS-Next, the format is the W3C subset of ISO 8601.

At the URL-Path /gvs-modification-dates an inverse chronological list of modification dates can be 
retreived using the same parameter as for the /gvs service

  About This Site
</h1>

<div style="width: 70%; margin-left: 5%">
<p>
HP have set up this site to enable anyone who wishes to assist 
with our research into provenance and versioning of Semantic Web
data to contribute such public data for

<ol>
<li>other users to explore as they see fit</li>
<li>exercising our implementation on wild data</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
While we are grateful for all contributions,
we cannot make any warranties whatsoever 
regarding any aspect of
our storage of your data in this way.
Thus, before placing your data on this site,
please make sure that you are aware of, and agree to, the following:

<ol>

Accordingly, please do not put your data in the store unless
you are happy for it to be copied and otherwise disseminated
without fetter.

<h1>Graph Versioning System</h1>

<h2>What is GVS?</h2>

<p>GVS allows persistent storage of RDF graphs, keeping track of provenance
(which source supplied the statements) and history (which statements were
added to/removed from the graph and when). Retrievals can specify unions
over multiple sources and points in time.
</p>

<p>An instance of GVS is usable directly through it's Java API,
remotely through a RESTfull HTTP interface, or using an AJAX
Web-Application.
</p>

<p>GVS is experimental software intended for research purposes as
part of the <a href="http://www.jena.sourceforge.net">Jena</a> family.
</p>

<h2 id="working">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Basing on the concept of 
<a href="http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/paper/html/id/240/">RDF Molecules</a>
GVS splits every graph into components.
A metamodel contains the information about which source is asserting
which component during which periods.
</p>

<h2>Where's the source?</h2>

<p>You can check out the module 'gvs' from the CVS repository at
:pserver:anonymous@jena.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jena.
More information on how to access the CVS repository can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=40417">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>What is this Web-Site?</h2>

<p>This site hosts a public GVS-Store. You can open an account
and become a source. Accounts are weakly password-protected.
</p>

<h2 id="password">Forgot/modify password?</h2>

<p>If you forgot your password or want to change it,
reopen the account: if your username and email match
the existing account, the password will be reset after you 
click on the confirmation link sent by email.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>Questions can be sent to the <a href="mailto:jena-dev@yahoogroups.com">Jena-Dev Mailing list</a> 
with subject starting with <strong>[GVS]</strong> or directly to <a href="mailto:chris.dollin@hp.com">Chris Dollin</a>
